# Getting Started with Create React App
# My personal website

### This is my personal website. It's built with React, and hosted on Amazon Web Services.

Here are available commands, if you would like to test this app out locally:

### `npm start` - Starts the app in the browser.
### `npm test` - Runs tests.
### `npm run build` - Builds the app for production.
### `npm run eject` - I'll be honest, I never use this.
